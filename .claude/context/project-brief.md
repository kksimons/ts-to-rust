# Project Brief

## What It Does

**Claude Code PM** is a comprehensive project management system designed specifically for AI-assisted software development using Claude Code. It transforms the traditional single-threaded development approach into a parallel, spec-driven workflow that scales from solo developers to distributed teams.

### Core Purpose
- **Eliminates context loss** between development sessions
- **Enables parallel development** with multiple AI agents
- **Enforces spec-driven development** to prevent "vibe coding"
- **Integrates with GitHub** for team collaboration and transparency
- **Scales AI-assisted development** beyond solo work to team environments

## Why It Exists

### Problems Solved

#### Context Evaporation
Traditional Claude Code sessions lose context when conversations end. Developers constantly re-explain project state, requirements, and technical decisions.

#### Serial Development Bottleneck  
AI-assisted development typically follows one conversation thread, implementing features sequentially rather than leveraging AI's ability to work in parallel.

#### "Vibe Coding" Risk
Without systematic planning, AI development can drift from requirements, leading to implementations that don't match actual needs.

#### Collaboration Gaps
AI-assisted development often happens in isolation, making it difficult for teams to coordinate, review, and build upon AI-generated work.

#### Progress Invisibility
Stakeholders and team members can't see development progress until features are complete, creating communication and planning challenges.

### Market Gap
No existing project management system is designed specifically for AI-assisted development workflows. Traditional tools assume human developers with different cognitive patterns and collaboration needs.

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success Indicators (30 days)
- **Context Preservation**: Developers never need to re-explain project state
- **Parallel Execution**: Average 3-5 concurrent work streams per feature
- **Spec Compliance**: 100% of code traces to written specifications  
- **GitHub Integration**: All work items tracked through standard GitHub Issues

### Medium-term Success (90 days)
- **Team Adoption**: 3+ team members using system simultaneously
- **Velocity Improvement**: 2-3x faster feature delivery vs traditional development
- **Quality Metrics**: 50%+ reduction in bug reports and rework
- **Collaboration Flow**: Seamless human-AI handoffs in development work

### Long-term Success (1 year)
- **Industry Standard**: Recognized approach for AI-assisted team development
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Third-party integrations and extensions
- **Scale Validation**: Teams of 10+ developers using system effectively
- **Measurable ROI**: Quantified productivity and quality improvements

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Systematic Development Process**
   - PRD → Epic → Tasks → Implementation workflow
   - Complete traceability from requirements to code
   - Elimination of ad-hoc "vibe coding"

2. **Context Preservation System**
   - Project-wide context maintained across sessions
   - Epic-specific context bubbles for focused work
   - Agent specialization with shared understanding

3. **Parallel Execution Framework**
   - Multiple AI agents working simultaneously on different aspects
   - Git worktrees for conflict-free concurrent development
   - Intelligent coordination and merge strategies

4. **GitHub-Native Collaboration**
   - Issues as project database and coordination mechanism
   - Real-time progress updates through issue comments
   - Integration with existing team workflows and tools

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Developer Experience Optimization**
   - Intuitive command interface (`/pm:*` commands)
   - Clear error messages and recovery suggestions
   - Minimal setup and configuration requirements

2. **Quality Assurance Integration**
   - Built-in validation and system integrity checking
   - Progress transparency for code review processes
   - Audit trails for compliance and documentation

3. **Scalability Architecture**
   - Works equally well for solo developers and distributed teams
   - Handles projects from simple features to complex multi-epic initiatives
   - Performance maintained as team size and project complexity grow

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Requires GitHub CLI** for issue management and authentication
- **Shell script implementation** limits platform compatibility  
- **Git repository required** for version control and worktree management
- **Claude Code specific** - designed for this particular AI assistant

### Organizational Assumptions
- Teams are comfortable with GitHub Issues workflow
- Developers have sufficient permissions for repository management
- Management supports systematic vs ad-hoc development approaches
- Team members willing to adopt structured planning processes

### Resource Constraints
- **Open source development model** - community-driven enhancement
- **No external dependencies** beyond GitHub CLI and Git
- **Minimal infrastructure requirements** - runs entirely locally with GitHub sync

## Strategic Vision

### Short-term (6 months)
Establish Claude Code PM as the standard approach for individual developers using AI assistance, with proven workflows and measurable productivity improvements.

### Medium-term (1-2 years)  
Scale to team environments with robust collaboration features, third-party integrations, and case studies demonstrating ROI for engineering organizations.

### Long-term (2+ years)
Become the de facto project management system for AI-assisted software development, with ecosystem of tools, templates, and best practices.
