# Project Overview

## High-Level Summary

Claude Code PM is a battle-tested project management system that transforms AI-assisted development from single-threaded conversations into parallel, spec-driven workflows. Built specifically for Claude Code, it enables developers and teams to ship faster and better by eliminating context loss, enabling parallel execution, and integrating seamlessly with GitHub workflows.

## Core Features

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Workflow
- **PRD Creation** (`/pm:prd-new`) - Comprehensive brainstorming for feature requirements
- **Epic Planning** (`/pm:prd-parse`) - Transform PRDs into technical implementation plans  
- **Task Breakdown** (`/pm:epic-decompose`) - Decompose epics into actionable, parallelizable tasks
- **GitHub Sync** (`/pm:epic-sync`) - Push work items to GitHub Issues with proper relationships

### 2. Context Preservation System
- **Project Context** (`.claude/context/`) - Maintains project understanding across sessions
- **Epic Context** - Each epic maintains its own context bubble for focused work
- **Agent Inheritance** - Specialized agents inherit context from shared directories
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time updates maintain accurate project state

### 3. Parallel Execution Framework
- **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Multiple AI agents working simultaneously on different aspects
- **Git Worktrees** - Isolated environments for conflict-free concurrent development
- **Task Coordination** - Intelligent coordination through Git commits and file locks
- **Merge Management** - Clean integration of parallel work streams

### 4. GitHub Native Integration  
- **Issues as Database** - GitHub Issues serve as project database and coordination mechanism
- **Real-time Updates** - Progress flows to GitHub automatically through issue comments
- **Team Collaboration** - Human team members can participate through standard GitHub workflows
- **Audit Trail** - Complete traceability from requirements through implementation

## Current State

### Fully Implemented Features ✅
- **Core PM Commands** - Complete set of `/pm:*` commands for workflow management
- **System Infrastructure** - Directory structure, configuration, and validation systems
- **GitHub Integration** - Full GitHub CLI integration with gh-sub-issue extension

- **Agent Framework** - Specialized agent definitions for different work types

### Available Commands
```bash
# Setup and Status  
/pm:init              # Initialize system and dependencies
