# Product Context

## Target Users

### Primary Users: Software Development Teams
- **Individual Developers** using Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- **Small Teams** (2-5 developers) working on collaborative projects
- **Engineering Managers** needing visibility into AI-assisted development progress
- **Solo Founders** building products with AI assistance

### User Personas

#### "The Claude Code Power User"
- Uses Claude Code daily for development tasks
- Loses context between sessions
- Wants parallel development capabilities  
- Needs better project organization and tracking

#### "The Engineering Manager"
- Manages team using AI-assisted development
- Needs visibility into what AI agents are doing
- Wants integration with existing GitHub workflows
- Requires audit trails and progress transparency

#### "The Solo Founder"
- Building products with AI assistance
- Wants to scale development velocity
- Needs systematic approach to feature development
- Requires clear progress tracking for stakeholder updates

## Core Functionality

### Project Management Workflow
1. **PRD Creation** - Structured brainstorming for feature requirements
2. **Epic Planning** - Technical implementation planning from PRDs  
3. **Task Decomposition** - Breaking epics into actionable tasks
4. **GitHub Integration** - Syncing work items with GitHub Issues
5. **Parallel Execution** - Multiple AI agents working simultaneously
6. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time visibility into development progress

### Key Features

#### Spec-Driven Development
- Forces thorough upfront planning
- Eliminates "vibe coding" from memory
- Creates complete audit trail from idea to code
- Ensures every line of code traces to requirements

#### Context Preservation
- Project state persists across Claude sessions
- Epic-specific context bubbles
- Agent specialization with shared understanding
- No context loss between development sessions

#### Parallel Development
- Multiple agents working on same epic simultaneously
- Git worktrees for conflict-free concurrent development
- Intelligent task parallelization detection
- Coordinated execution with independent progress

#### GitHub Native Integration
- Uses existing GitHub Issues workflow
- No additional tools or databases required
- Team collaboration through issue comments
- Seamless human-AI handoffs

## Use Cases

### Feature Development Lifecycle
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create comprehensive PRD through guided brainstorming
   - Convert PRD to technical implementation plan
   - Break down into parallelizable tasks

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Launch specialized agents for different work streams
   - Database agent handles schema changes
   - API agent implements endpoints  
   - UI agent builds interface components
   - Test agent creates comprehensive test coverage

3. **Coordination Phase**
   - Progress updates flow to GitHub automatically
   - Team members see real-time progress in issues
   - Human developers can jump in at any point
   - Clean merge of all parallel work streams

### Team Collaboration Scenarios

#### Distributed Team Development
- Multiple Claude instances working on same project
- Progress visible to all team members
- Context shared through GitHub issue system
- No "what did the AI do?" confusion

#### Human-AI Handoffs
- AI starts feature, human finishes (or vice versa)
- Complete context available in issue comments
- Code reviews happen naturally through PRs
- Seamless transition between human and AI work

#### Management Visibility
- Engineering managers see progress without interrupting flow
- Audit trail from requirements to implementation
- Clear attribution of work to AI vs human contributions
- Progress metrics available through GitHub insights

## Success Criteria

### Developer Productivity
- **89% reduction** in context switching time
