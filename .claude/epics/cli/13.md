# Task: Validation & Error Handling

## Description
Implement comprehensive validation and error handling systems for the CLI TypeScript-to-Rust generator. This includes TypeScript syntax validation, Rust compilation verification, semantic analysis checks, and user-friendly error reporting with actionable suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript file validation with syntax and semantic checks
- [ ] Rust compilation validation with rustc integration
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages with file locations and suggestions
- [ ] Input validation for CLI arguments and file paths
- [ ] Graceful handling of edge cases and malformed inputs
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms where possible

## Technical Details
- Integrate TypeScript compiler API for validation
- Use rustc for Rust code compilation checks
- Implement error aggregation and reporting system
- Create custom error types with context information
- Add validation middleware for all transformation steps
- Files affected: src/validation/, src/errors/, src/cli/

## Dependencies
- [ ] Core transformation engine (Task 002)
- [ ] Type system implementation (Task 006)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
