# Task: TypeScript DSL Parser

## Description
Implement TypeScript Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing using ts-morph library to extract model and route definitions from TypeScript files. This parser will identify and extract the structure needed for Rust code generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ts-morph integration setup and configured
- [ ] TypeScript model parsing (interfaces, types, classes)
- [ ] Route definition extraction from TypeScript files
- [ ] AST traversal and data structure extraction
- [ ] Error handling for malformed TypeScript code
- [ ] Support for common TypeScript patterns and decorators

## Technical Details
- Integrate ts-morph for TypeScript AST parsing
- Create model extractors for interfaces and type definitions
- Implement route pattern recognition and extraction
- Build intermediate representation (IR) data structures
- Handle TypeScript-specific features (generics, unions, etc.)
- Create validation for parsed structures

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is a foundation task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
