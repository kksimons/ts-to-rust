# Task: Database Integration & Schema Generation

## Description
Implement comprehensive database integration capabilities for the TypeScript-to-Rust generator, including Diesel schema generation, migration creation, and multi-database support. This task focuses on translating TypeScript data models and database schemas into Rust-compatible Diesel schemas with proper type mappings and relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generate Diesel schema.rs files from TypeScript interfaces and types
- [ ] Create database migration files with proper up/down migrations
- [ ] Support multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- [ ] Map TypeScript types to appropriate Diesel/SQL types
- [ ] Generate proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- [ ] Handle optional fields and nullable types correctly
- [ ] Support database indexing and unique constraints
- [ ] Generate connection pool configuration

## Technical Details
- Implement TypeScript AST parsing for interface definitions and type annotations
- Create mapping tables for TypeScript to SQL type conversion
- Generate Diesel table macros with proper attribute annotations
- Support embedded structs and complex type relationships
- Handle timestamp fields and auto-generated columns
- Files/directories affected: src/generators/database/, src/mappers/db_types.rs

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: TypeScript AST parsing and analysis
- [ ] Task 003: Core CLI framework and configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full database schema generation
- [ ] Tests written covering all supported database types
- [ ] Documentation updated with database configuration examples
- [ ] Code reviewed and integrated with CLI framework
