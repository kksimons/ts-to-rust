# Task: Middleware & Security Generation

## Description
Generate comprehensive middleware and security components for the Rust backend, including JWT authentication, CORS configuration, rate limiting, request validation, and other security-focused middleware. This task translates TypeScript security patterns and middleware into Rust equivalents using tower/axum middleware patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generate JWT authentication middleware with token validation
- [ ] Create CORS middleware with configurable origins and methods
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware with Redis/in-memory backends
- [ ] Generate request validation middleware using validator crate
- [ ] Create logging and tracing middleware for observability
- [ ] Generate security headers middleware (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Support role-based authorization middleware
- [ ] Create middleware composition and ordering configuration

## Technical Details
- Implement tower::Layer trait for custom middleware components
- Generate JWT handling with jsonwebtoken crate integration
- Create configurable CORS policies based on TypeScript CORS settings
- Implement rate limiting using governor or similar crate
- Generate validation schemas from TypeScript type definitions
- Support middleware ordering and dependency resolution
- Files/directories affected: src/generators/middleware/, src/templates/security/

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006: Backend code generation for middleware integration points

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all security middleware components
- [ ] Tests written covering middleware functionality and integration
- [ ] Documentation updated with security configuration examples
- [ ] Code reviewed with security best practices validation
