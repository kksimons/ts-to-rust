# Task: Rust Code Templates System

## Description
Build a comprehensive Tera template system for generating Rust code including models (structs, enums), route handlers, and main.rs application files. This system will transform parsed TypeScript structures into idiomatic Rust code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tera template engine integration and configuration
- [ ] Rust model templates (structs, enums, traits)
- [ ] Route handler templates with proper Rust patterns
- [ ] Main application template with server setup
- [ ] Template helpers for type mapping and code generation
- [ ] Support for Rust-specific features (ownership, lifetimes)

## Technical Details
- Setup Tera templating engine with custom filters
- Create templates for Rust struct and enum generation
- Implement route handler templates with axum/warp patterns
- Build main.rs template with server configuration
- Create TypeScript-to-Rust type mapping system
- Implement template helpers for naming conventions

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is a foundation task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
